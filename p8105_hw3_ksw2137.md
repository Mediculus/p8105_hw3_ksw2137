# Introduction

Homework for showing capability in data visualization and exploratory
data analysis

# Problem 1

``` r
# Loads instacart data from source
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

# Assigns a new dataframe to the data-source to prevent frequent "reloads"
### Not sure if necessary.
insta_df <- instacart %>%  
  janitor::clean_names()
```

The InstaCart dataset collects data on customers and the things they
order from local groceries. Data that we’re using are cleaned previously
and is limited because it only contains data from `eval_set = train`;
likely dataset used in model-building. The dataframe contains 1384617
observations from 15 categories including `eval_set`. All these
variables are linked in some way. For example, these variables are
likely of particular importance:

  - `order_id`: order identifier; if a person starts an order, all the
    items inside will have the same `order_id`
  - `product_id`: product identifier which links a value to certain
    products (e.g. 340 = cake, 255 = soda, etc)
  - `user_id`: customer identifier; unique id for customers (Peanut’s id
    = 1000, John’s id = 13,…)
  - `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed (Mon,
    Tues, Wed,…)
  - `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was
    placed (13:00, 21:00,…)
  - `product_name`: name of product such as “Organic Garlic”, “Spring
    Water”, or “Xpolsive Pizza Baked Snack Cracker”
  - `aisle_id`: aisle identifier that is linked to `aisle` as a unique
    identifier
  - `department_id`: department identifier
  - `aisle`: the name of the aisle such as fresh vegetables or yogurt
  - `department`: the name of the department (canned goods, snacks,
    frozen, …)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
aisle_summary <- insta_df %>% 
  select(product_name, aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = as.factor(aisle),
    aisle_id = as.factor(aisle_id)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, aisle_id) %>% 
  summarize(
    aisle_order_count = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(aisle_order_count))
```

As indicated above, this is a very large dataset. It contains 134 unique
aisles and fresh vegetables is/are the most ordered item with 150609
orders. A graph below illustrates the spread of the number of items
ordered in each aisle for items with more than 10,000 items ordered.

``` r
aisle_summary %>% 
  filter(aisle_order_count > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = aisle_order_count, color = aisle)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    #labs(title = "***", 
     #  subtitle = "***",
      # x = "***",
       #y = "***",
      # color = "***") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 8),
        legend.position = "none")
```

  - Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

  - Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

  - Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

# Problem 2

For this problem, we will be loading the BRFSS data included in the
p8105 package.

``` r
brfss_df <- data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, do some data cleaning:

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”
Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010? Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help). Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State. Problem 3 Accelerometers have become an appealing
alternative to self-report techniques for studying physical activity in
observational studies and clinical trials, largely because of their
relative objectivity. During observation periods, the devices measure
“activity counts” in a short period; one-minute intervals are common.
Because accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they
produce around-the-clock observations.

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The data can be downloaded here. In this
spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for each
minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc). Traditional
analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day.
Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total
activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.
Are any trends apparent? Accelerometer data allows the inspection
activity over the course of the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows
the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate
day of the week. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can
make based on this graph. Optional post-assignment survey If you’d like,
a you can complete this short survey after you’ve finished the
assignment.
